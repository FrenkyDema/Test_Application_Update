Test Application Update is a desktop application developed in Python to demonstrate how to perform automatic desktop application updates. The application checks for the availability of new versions on GitHub, downloads the update file, and replaces it with the old application file. The application includes a simple user interface with a button to start the update process. The application was developed using Python libraries customtkinter, requests, and aiohttp.

## Usage

1. To download the latest version of the app directly from GitHub releases, follow these steps:
    - Go to the GitHub releases page of the application.
    - Find the latest version of the application and look for the .exe file.
    - Click the link to download the .exe file.
2. After downloading the .exe file, follow these steps to open the application:
    - Find the downloaded .exe file on your computer.
    - Double-click the file to start the application.
